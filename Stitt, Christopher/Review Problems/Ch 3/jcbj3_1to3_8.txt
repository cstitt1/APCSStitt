Chapter 3 Review Exercises:

Java Concepts & Big Java 3.1 - 3.3:
R3.1: The parameter is not strictly necessary because the object can be made without it.

Java Concepts & Big Java 3.4 - 3.5, 3.7:
R3.2: The first makes just a variable. The second makes a variable that directs to an object.
R3.3: The first makes just an object. The second makes a variable that directs to an object.
R3.11: While both only live for the length of the method run time, one is initialized by the value put into the method

R3.12: One is initialized by the usual process and lives for the length of the method run time, while the other lives for
