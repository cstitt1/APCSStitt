Chapter 2 Review Exercises:

Java Concepts & Big Java 2.1 - 2.3:
R2.5: In Java, the "=" symbol means that something references to something else. In math, it means that something equals or is something else.

Java Concepts & Big Java 2.4 - 2.7:
R2.4: new Rectangle(5,5,10,10);
	  Rectangle example = new Rectangle(5,5,10,10);
	  
R2.7: new Rectangle(100,100,50,50);
	  "Hello, Dave!";

R2.8: Rectangle answer = new Rectangle(100,100,50,50);
	  String hd = "Hello, Dave!";

R2.9: a. There is no constructor to finish the declaration. 
      b. The word new is missing, so it is not seen as an object.
      c. There is no constructor, so there are no coordinates to change with the translate method.
      d. First, there needs to be the class name in front of the object variable. 
         Second, translate does not work on a object without coordinates.
         Third,  translate takes two int's, not one string.
         
Java Concepts & Big Java 2.8 - 2.10:
R2.3: An object is a variable whose type is a class. A class is a programmer-defined data type.

R2.10: Two accessors are getX() and getY(). Two mutators are setX() and setY().

R2.11: It extends the rectangle so that one point on it is (0,0).
