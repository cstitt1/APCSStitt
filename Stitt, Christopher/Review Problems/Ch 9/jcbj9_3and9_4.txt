R9.7: It is polymorphism because there are multiple getBounds() methods that could be called.

R9.9: For the first DataSet, you need to implement Measurable and code its methods.
	  For the second, you just need to call the method for that object and have a class to measure it that implements measurer.
	  The second is easier because it requires less complicated code and it has more uses.
